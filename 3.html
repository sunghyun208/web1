The Javanese script, natively known as Aksara Jawa (ꦲaꦏ꧀ꦱksaꦫraꦗjaꦮwa) and Hanacaraka (ꦲhaꦤnaꦕcaꦫra
ꦏka), formally known as Déntawyanjana (ꦢꦺdéꦤ꧀ꦠntaꦮꦾwyaꦚ꧀ꦗnyjaꦤna) and Carakan (ꦕcaꦫraꦏkaꦤ꧀n), is an abugida developed by the Javanese people to write several
 Austronesian languages spoken in Indonesia, primarily the Javanese language and an early form of Javanese called Kawi, as well as Sanskrit, an Indo-Aryan
 language used as a sacred language throughout Asia. The Javanese script is a descendant of the Brahmi script and therefore has many similarities with the
  modern scripts of South India and Southeast Asia. The Javanese script, along with the Balinese script, is considered the most elaborate and ornate among
  Brahmic scripts of Southeast Asia.[1]
